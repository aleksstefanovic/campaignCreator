# Campaign Creator
Shoelace assessment

Overview

A simple React frontend app that allows the user to select a template for a advertising campaign, modify any of those values (optional part of the assignment), and then 'publish' the campaign. No data is persistent. The app is entirely a SPA, and is setup so that everything is contained within the Steps component, keeping it modular. All configuration for the templates and possible accepted values is maintained through a series of configuration files under /src/config. 

How to run
1) Run `npm install`
2) Run `npm run`
3) Go to http://localhost:3000
